## Concepts

>[!INFO] **Abstraction Layer**
>
>Process to hide implementation details from user
>Each layer can access the feature below it, but no layer can access layers above it

- Abstraction can improve code flexibility and maintenance, it can also pose problems to incident handling and forensics
- Entities should understand the complex hierarchies of abstraction layers, such as in many cloud-computing environments, and understand the different ways in which digital is lost due to abstraction layers.

>[!WARNING] Adversarial testing
>
>Methods or techniques used during a software evaluation to force the software to behave in unintended ways or to bypass **software security controls**

>[!INFO] Application Program Interface
>
>Series of communication protocols, subroutines and tools for building software that allows 2 applications to interact with each other

>[!HELP] Assessor
>
>Individuals and companies approved by PCI SSC to performance security assessments against PCI standards, including those standards associated with [[#^d952cc|SSF]]
>

>[!SUCCESS] Big number libraries
>
>Library functions that allow for the large numbers often used in cryptography to be processed and stored correctly (with needed levels of precision) in languages that may otherwise default to a less precise format.

>[!DANGER] Commom Weakness Enumeration
>
>Category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities
